## Scales of Variables

#### (1.) Scales of Variation in the sampling design.
**Scales**: Between state variation and between county variation (residual)
  
**Grouping variables**
  The grouping variables / random effects are states which are comprised of counties state(county)

#### (2.) Scale of Response Variable.
   **Hectares of protected area (PA_ha)**

#### (3.) Scales of measurement for Predictor Variables.
  **GAP Status (1-4)** = between county predictor and **State GDP** = between state predictor (?)

## The Model:

#### (1.) The Statistical Model in mathematical notation:
**State Level Model:**
$$\mu _{j}\sim N(\mu, \sigma ^{2})$$
**County Level Model**
$$y_{i}\sim N(\mu _{j[i]}, \sigma ^{2})$$

$$\mu _{j}=State\ Mean\ Hectares\ of\ Protected\ Area$$ 

$$j[i]=State\ j\ that\ belongs\ to\ county\ i$$
